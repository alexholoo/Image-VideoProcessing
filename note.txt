Chapter 2. Digital Image Fundamentals
Image Sampling & Quantization, Discrete,

3D info:
	Sensor array, e.g. 512*512, Pixel, AD conversion,
		Spatial quantization
		resolution: detail vs coarse
	Gray scale, 256,
		Gray value quantization
			e.g. 7/2*2 = 6
		gray level: 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 (black & white)

Pro Cameras: RGB, Red, Green, Blue.
Consumer Camera s: Mosaic sensors & Interpolation
Images -> Video, ~30*3 images per second.

Week 2
vid 7 image compression (chapter 8)
why?
1000*1000 pixels * 24 bits * 30 frames/s * 60 s/min * 120 min/h => a 2h movie =>
very large number!!! => image & video compression

Redundancy: few colors, same color in regions, irrelevant info.

Image compression standards, formats and containers
	Image: JPEG, JPEG-LS, JPEG-2000, etc.
	Video: MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, etc.

image -> f(x,y) or f(x,y,t) -> Mapper (array) -> Quantizer (info loss)
-> Symbol coder (information theory, storage | transmission) =>
Symbol decoder -> Inverse mapper -> f`(x,y) or f`(x,y,t)

e.g. JPEG
Input image (M*N) -> Construct n*n subimages -> Forward transform -> Quantizer
-> Symbol encoder -> Compressed image
Compressed image -> symbol decoder -> inverse transform -> Merge n*n subimages
-> decompressed image


p008 Huffman coding
Picture Lina, frequency count, histogram, probability
Huffman coding
	Variable length code: higher the probability, lower the length
	prefix-free code
	theorem: shortest coding length on average
		compression ratio
		Entropy (H) = -SUM_symbols^(p(s)*log_2^(p(s)))
			average code length (Shannon's 1st theorem)
